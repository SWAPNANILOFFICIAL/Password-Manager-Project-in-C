**Password Manager Project**

*Description:*

Developed a password manager in C, allowing users to securely store, retrieve, update, and delete account information. The program provides a user-friendly interface with menu options and incorporates basic encryption techniques to enhance security.

*Key Features:*

1. **Authentication:** Users are required to set and enter a master password for access, ensuring secure authentication.
   
2. **Account Operations:** The password manager supports adding new accounts, retrieving passwords, updating account information, and deleting accounts.

3. **Data Encryption:** Utilizes a simple XOR encryption key to secure sensitive information, enhancing the privacy of stored passwords.

4. **Password Strength Indicator:** Provides a basic password strength indicator, aiding users in creating robust passwords.

5. **Persistence:** Accounts are saved to a file ("passwords.dat") for persistence across program sessions.

6. **Display All Accounts:** Users can view a list of all stored accounts, including usernames, decrypted passwords, websites, and notes.

*Usage:*

1. Run the program.
2. Authenticate using the master password.
3. Choose from the menu options to perform various account operations.
4. Safely exit the program.

*Technologies:*

- **Language:** C
- **File Handling:** Used for saving and loading accounts to and from a file.
- **Encryption:** Simple XOR encryption for password protection.

*Improvements:*

Future enhancements may include implementing a more advanced encryption algorithm, improving the user interface, and incorporating additional security features.
